                        <p class="justified font-x1">In an election year as consequential as this one, you might argue that you
                            don't have the time or brain space to read. We get it--when the world is a dumpster fire,
                            the obvious balm is to crawl into bed, fire up Netflix, and pull the blankets over your
                            head. But in the words of the great Susan Sontag, "The day has pockets--you can always find
                            time to read." Whether your pockets occur on your commute, in the hour before your bedtime,
                            or while you wait in line at the pharmacy, 2020 holds no shortage of special books with
                            which to fill those interstices.</p>
                        <p class="justified font-x1">We rounded up some of our favorites, ranging from incisive reporting on hot
                            button subjects like Silicon Valley and the housing crisis to exemplary fiction about such
                            diverse subjects as family, identity, and romance. With a slate of books this good, there's
                            no excuse not to read. Watch this space--we'll be adding more as the year progresses. </p>
