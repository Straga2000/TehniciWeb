                            The Name of the Wind is an epic fantasy by Patrick Rothfuss in which the legendary hero Kvothe, now in hiding as Waystone Inn owner Kote, recounts his past experiences to Chronicler, a story collector. The book forms the first of the three parts of Rothfuss’s Kingkiller Chronicle. When the novel begins, demon spiders have been encountered near the Waystone Inn. Only a few locals who regularly gather at the Inn are aware of them. Meanwhile, Devan Lochees, a famous writer and story collector known as Chronicler, comes to the Inn to see if Kote is actually Kvothe. With a little urging, Kvothe agrees to tell the story of his life to Chronicler. Kvothe explains it will take three days. Each day forms a book in Rothfuss' trilogy.

                            The novel steps back in time. Kvothe is a child among the Edema Ruh, the class of traveling performers made up of countless troupes. Kvothe’s parents are musicians, who are well-respected for their songs. The troupe takes on an arcanist, Ben Abenthy, who earns his keep by providing medicines and other similar services. Abenthy, as an arcanist, is akin to a magician. He has the ability to control matter and nature through the practice of speaking, or name-calling. He begins to teach these techniques to Kvothe. He encourages Kvothe on to University.
